Cysteine is one of the most peculiar amino acids found in nature. Depending on the micro-environment, it can perform various different functions. The focus of this study is to build machine learning models that would take in the properties of the cysteine micro-environment as its features and predict the function that the cysteine performs. Two prediction schemes were employed. The first is structure-based and the second is sequence-based.
