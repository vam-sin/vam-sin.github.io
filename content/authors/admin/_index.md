Hello! I am Vamsi Nallapareddy! I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the [Orengo Laboratory](http://orengogroup.info/) under the supervision of [Prof. Christine Orengo](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/orengo-group/people/prof-christine-orengo) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). 

I worked on multiple projects during the course of my bachelor's degree in different domains such as Computational Biology, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Reinforcement Learning. Exploring these different fields has helped me find a passion for the application of deep learning techniques to learn more from biological data in order to build applications and tools that can make a positive impact in the world. 

Apart from my academic work, I like to read books, design, and write. 

I am actively looking for Ph.D. opportunities starting in the Fall of 2022. Please feel free to get in touch with me if you want to have a chat!
