Hello! I am Vamsi Nallapareddy, a final year Computer Science undergraduate student from [BITS Pilani - Hyderabad Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/). I am currently doing my Bachelor's Thesis at the [Orengo Laboratory](http://orengogroup.info/) under the supervision of [Prof. Christine Orengo](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/orengo-group/people/prof-christine-orengo) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). 

I have taken up multiple projects during the course of my bachelor's degree in different domains such as Computational Biology, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Reinforcement Learning. Exploring these different fields has helped me find a passion for the application of deep learning techniques to learn more from biological data.
